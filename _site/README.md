# Abstract
#### The problem: 
During the period of pandemic, face masks and social distance are necessary for everyone’s safety concerns; however, as shown on the school’s website, there are still new COVID cases being discovered almost every day in UCLA while we can still see many students walking around the campus without the mask on.  
If we can build a real-time face mask detection program, we could provide friendly reminders to those who didn’t put their masks on so to create a safer environment on campus to solve the problem that it is difficult to check and make sure everyone has followed the guidance.
#### The overall approach:
The goal of this face mask detection project is to create an image recognition system by executing image classification accurately.        
In order to achieve detecting masks in images first and then later try to detect masks in real-time video streams, we will need to build and train our face mask detector on a training set then test the detector on a test set, also making any further modifications if necessary.

# Planned Deliverables
Concisely state what you are aiming to create and what capabilities it will have. 
We are aiming to create a real-time face mask detection system that can accurately classify people who have weared the masks and those who haven't so to provide a friendly reminder to those haven't in order to create a safer campus environment.  
We will be making a face mask detection system and the core will be building a successful face mask detector.
#### “Full success.” 
We will be making a real-time face masks detection system that can accurately detect whether a person has weared a mask or not even, and this capability should work under variables such as gender, race, patterns on the masks, size of the masks, and the fit of the masks.    
The interface in this case would be a Jupyter notebook containing the necessary code.
#### “Partial success.”
Even if our real-time face masks detection system is not perfect, we would still expect a successful deliver of a face mask detection system working accurately on images.
The interface in this case would be a Jupyter notebook containing the necessary code.
