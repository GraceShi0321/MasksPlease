# Abstract
The problem: 
During the period of pandemic, face masks and social distance are necessary for everyone’s safety concerns; however, as shown on the school’s website, there are still new COVID cases being discovered almost every day in UCLA while we can still see many students walking around the campus without the mask on.
If we can build a real-time face mask detection program, we could provide friendly reminder to those who didn’t put their masks on so to create a safer environment on campus to solve the problem that it is difficult to check and make sure everyone has followed the guidance.
The overall approach:
The goal of this face mask detection project is to create an image recognition system by executing image classification accurately. 
In order to achieve detecting masks in images first and then later try to detect masks in real-time video streams, we will need to build and train our face mask detector on a training set then test the detector on a test set, also making any further modifications if necessary.
